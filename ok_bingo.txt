yaiks.


so,
we can't get htm with ajax-ed by using python simply, instead
we must use marionet in python world, yey, we can get dinamically-changed one by this.
as Masha say.

basically
we can make call html like above mention,
we can see Pot-point ( entering-point ) by grepping as 'href'
so we can aware 'taken by ..'
we surplizingly keep loading htm by exactly one which getting now. [until reach targ]

so we can see end of material, and I awared da path of mp4, yaiks.[ this is not in JSON,
which used to be inside it only 1 week ago, but da method is exception]

why we seek token or query id?
why we dig da JSON?
we are not seeing id or json data but content output to my browser. offcourse website didnt emit json mainly
but contents.
at the same time we dont need to parse json all the time.
so approach transformation.


things described above is hand-play but also all in python, so , any one can make automate whole.

we must change style of base of approach.
plz wait a moment.
