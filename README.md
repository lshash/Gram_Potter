# Instagram Clipper
this code is bit old, some part won't work anymore. though this is just idea of how to
fetch contents from the site as the way of fetch is not just to target to the sites very
contents but it marely looks the result content after the ajax processing.
so the user, or client of web, we, already have all material in the local side actually.
not before ajax, but just after that. and simply seeks it and query and well done.

## usage
arrange your 'where.csv'
bulky_potter.sh
```

## requirements  
python2.7
