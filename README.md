# Instagram Clipper called grampotter
This is just idea of how to
fetch contents from the site as the way of fetch is not just to target to the sites very
contents but it marely looks the result content after the ajax processing. It means even if the sender have some minor change
of their side, the receiver always receives 'something'.
so the user, or client of web, we, already have all material in the local side actually.
not before ajax, but just after that. and simply seeks it and query and well done.

## usage
>python3 grampotter.py

## how to use it
```
python3
```
>pynput
>selenium
>geckodriver

pynput is not essential. though you should get the geckodriver executable.
and please modify the path in grampotter.py source.


## caution
please just don't use it cos it's not work properly, folk it, and bit change and it will work. Plus, py2.7 is already bit 
old man, 3 is better. just bit more steps, it will work.
