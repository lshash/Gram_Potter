# Instagram Clipper
this code is bit old, some part won't work anymore. though this is just idea of how to
fetch contents from the site as the way of fetch is not just to target to the sites very
contents but it marely looks the result content after the ajax processing. It means even if the sender have some minor change
of their side, the receiver always receives 'something'.
so the user, or client of web, we, already have all material in the local side actually.
not before ajax, but just after that. and simply seeks it and query and well done.

## usage
run the grampotter.py

## requirements  
```
python2.7  
```

## caution
please just don't use it cos it's not work properly, folk it, and bit change and it will work. Plus, py2.7 is already bit 
old man, 3 is better. I actually have it the version but not upload it yet. just bit more steps, it will work.
